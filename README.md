# CPUvsGPUBenchMark.cpp
C++ program using the NVIDIA CUDA API to demonstrate the power of parallel computing. 
The program generates three arrays, each of size 2^22 (4,194,304 elements), and then sums them element-wise into a result array. 
This calculation is performed both on the CPU and the GPU.
